# NYC-TAXI-TRIP-TIME-PREDICTION
The NYC Taxi Trip Time Prediction project is a machine learning regression model that attempts to estimate the time of a taxi ride in New York City based on a variety of input characteristics. The project's purpose is to increase the efficiency and convenience of taxi services by delivering more accurate journey length estimations for both clients and drivers.

# Project Overview
The project makes use of historical taxi trip data from New York City, including pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and trip distances. The data is preprocessed in order to deal with missing values and transform category variables into numerical values. To extract additional information from the data, such as the day of the week, time of day, and distances between sites, feature engineering techniques are used.

A number of regression techniques, including linear regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are used to train the model. To improve the model's performance, hyperparameter adjustment is used. Metrics such as mean absolute error and R-squared are used to evaluate models. The LightGBM Regression model was chosen as the final model since it performed the best of the models considered.

The trained model is evaluated against a hold-out test set and demonstrates great accuracy in forecasting cab journey time, with an average error of less than 10 minutes.

# Important Features
The research investigates the factors that determine the length of a taxi ride. The findings show that the most important elements in influencing the duration of a cab ride are pickup and dropoff locations, time of day, and route distance.

# Potential Improvements
The model may be improved in future iterations by including more data sources such as weather data, traffic data, and other transportation-related data. This would allow the model to take into consideration real-time factors that affect journey duration. Integrating the model with a real-time mapping and routing service would also give customers with up-to-date travel length estimates based on current traffic circumstances.

# Benefits and Applications
The NYC Taxi Trip Time Prediction project successfully constructs a machine learning regression model capable of accurately forecasting the duration of taxi journeys in New York City. The model might be used for a variety of purposes, including:

**Improved Taxi Services:** By offering more realistic estimations of travel length for both customers and drivers, taxi firms can improve the efficiency and convenience of their services. This aids in route planning and optimisation, as well as minimising wait times and enhancing client satisfaction.

**Informed Decision Making:** Passengers may use the model's forecasts to plan their travels more efficiently, manage their time, and make educated judgements regarding transit options.

**Transportation System Optimisation:** Transportation authorities can acquire insights into issues that effect traffic congestion and discover opportunities for improvement in transportation infrastructure by analysing the major elements determining journey duration.

# Future Development
Future work on the project may focus on improving the model's precision and investigating cutting-edge methods for feature engineering and model selection. Furthermore, combining real-time data and the model into a user-friendly application or API would make it simple to acquire precise forecasts of journey length.
